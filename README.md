# UI Test Automation with Python & Playwright

This project automates UI tests for [the-internet.herokuapp.com](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) using Python, pytest, and Playwright. It contains report generation using Allure and will later have API tests added.

## ✅ Prerequisites
- Python ≥ 3.9
- Git
- Playwright CLI (`pip install playwright`)
---

## ⚙️ Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAnitsu/PlaywrightUITest.git
cd PlaywrightUITest
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
The virtual environment is not included in the repository. Each user should generate it locally depending on their OS and activate it when running tests locally, then deactivate it after all the desired tests are done.

```bash
# Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate # activates environment
deactivate # !!deactivate environment after installing dependencies and running tests

# macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Deactivate virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install Playwright Browsers
```bash
playwright install
```
### 💡 Notes
The venv/ folder is excluded via .gitignore to keep the repository clean and OS-independent.

Regenerating the virtual environment ensures consistency across contributors without committing system-specific binaries.

## 🧪 Running Tests
Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```
Run a specific test file:
```bash
pytest tests/test_login.py
```
Run tests with detailed output:
```bash
pytest -v
```
Run tests and generate an easy to read report
```bash
pip install pytest-html
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html # to run the tests and generate the report
# Run tests with Allure Report
pip install allure-pytest
pytest --alluredir=reports/allure-results
allure serve reports/allure-results
```

## 📄 How to Create New Tests
### 1. Create a new file in pages/ to import the page fixtures:
```python
class YourPage:
    def __init__(self, page: Page): # in the constructor all the locators needed must be assigned
        self.page = page
        self.yourlocator = page.locator("#yourlocatorhere")

    def navigate(self): # navigate action is mandatory to be able to load the page
        self.page.goto("https://yourpagehere.test")

    def action(self): # define any action you need to be performed on locators, in this example checking a checkbox
        action = self.yourlocator.check()

    def check(self) -> bool: # define a check function that returns a boolean value to be able to check if an action was performed or not
        return self.yourlocator.is_checked()
```
### 2. Create a new file in tests/ where the tests will be written using the methods from the pages, making them easy to read, like scripts:
```bash
def test_yourpage(page):
    yourpage_page = YourPage(page)
    yourpage_page.navigate() # loads the page
    
    # perform action
    yourpage_page.action()

    # check that your action was performed
    assert yourpage_page.check() is True # if the action was performed, the test will pass, else the test will fail
```

### 3. Use Playwright commands:
- page.goto(url)
- page.fill(selector, text)
- page.click(selector)
- page.locator(selector).is_visible()
- page.locator(selector).inner_text()

## 🔎 Playwright Locator Tips
Examples:
```python
page.locator("#username")
page.locator(".button")
page.locator("button[type='submit']")
```

## 📂 Managing Test Data (will expand on this later with a script that creates test data)
For file upload tests, create a dummy file:
```bash
echo "Hello World" > testfile.txt
```

## 🚀 Ways to Expand This Project

### Done
✅ Implement the Page Object Model (POM)

✅ Generate HTML test reports (Allure)

### To do
✅ Use pytest parametrise to test multiple inputs

✅ Add API tests

✅ Integrate with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration

✅ Run tests in headless mode for speed

✅ Test on multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

## 📝 Useful Commands
Run Playwright Codegen (record actions):
```bash
playwright codegen https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
```
